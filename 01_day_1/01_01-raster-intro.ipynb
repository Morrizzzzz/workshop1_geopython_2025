However, as you can see on the image it also contains an artificial band to the top left where data is missing. In order to calculate meaningfull statistics, we need to take missing data into account. Raster data often has a “no data value” associated with it and for raster datasets read in by rioxarray. This value is referred to as nodata. This is a value assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected. There can be different cases that cause missing data, and it’s common for other values in a raster to represent different cases. The most common example is missing data at the edges of rasters.\n",

    "By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have a dataset that has a shape that isn’t rectangular, like most satellite images, some pixels at the edge of the raster will have no data values.
